# AWK
-  AWK follows a simple workflow âˆ’ Read, Execute, and Repeat. 

## Read
AWK reads a line from the input stream (file, pipe, or stdin) and stores it in memory.

## Execute
All AWK commands are applied sequentially on the input. By default AWK execute commands on every line. We can restrict this by providing patterns.

## Repeat
This process repeats until the file reaches its end.
